 * Build-time data model the plugin emits and the runtime later consumes
 * (after F7 encrypts it and F9 decrypts it back).
 *
 * Schema is versioned so that older blobs decoded by a newer runtime can be
 * detected and handled gracefully. Bump [SCHEMA_VERSION] whenever a field is
 * added, removed, or its semantics change.
 *
 * The `*ByAbi` maps were added in [SCHEMA_VERSION] = 2 to support
 * NATIVE_INTEGRITY_DESIGN.md (Component 1). They're keyed by Android
 * ABI string (`arm64-v8a`, `x86_64`, ...); empty for ABIs that ship
 * no `.so` files. The runtime consults the entry matching
 * `Build.SUPPORTED_ABIS[0]` and ignores the rest.
