/**
 * Smoke tests for [KeyAttestationDetector] structural invariants.
 *
 * The detector's full integration path (KeyStore.getInstance,
 * KeyPairGenerator with attestation challenge, X509 chain walk,
 * KeyDescription parse) is exercised end-to-end by the sample app
 * at `samples/minimal` against a real Android runtime — it cannot
 * run in pure JVM unit tests because `AndroidKeyStore` is a
 * device-side service.
 *
 * These tests cover only the parts that DO survive in a JVM-only
 * test runner (no Robolectric on the classpath): the stable
 * detector id and the test-only cache reset hook.
 *
 * The verdict and parser components carry their own deep coverage
 * via [IntegrityVerdictTest] and [KeyDescriptionParserTest].
