/**
 * Smoke tests for [BootloaderIntegrityDetector] structural invariants.
 *
 * The detector's full integration path (second AndroidKeyStore keygen,
 * X509 chain walks, signature verifications) is exercised end-to-end
 * by the sample app at `samples/minimal` against a real Android
 * runtime — it cannot run in pure JVM unit tests because
 * `AndroidKeyStore` is a device-side service.
 *
 * The cross-check logic itself has deep table-driven coverage in
 * [ChainValidatorTest]; the smoke tests here only assert the parts
 * that survive in a JVM-only test runner.
