package tech.thessemaj.deviceintelligence.internal

/**
 * Recovers the per-build XOR key used to encrypt the fingerprint blob.
 *
 * The key is split into N small chunks at build time (see
 * `tech.thessemaj.deviceintelligence.gradle.tasks.GenerateKeyChunksTask`) which live in
 * randomly-named sub-packages, e.g.:
 *
 *   tech.thessemaj.deviceintelligence.gen.p91a146bf.KeyChunk0
 *   tech.thessemaj.deviceintelligence.gen.pc5e4b145.KeyChunk1
 *   ...
 *
 * A single fixed-FQN entry point — [ASSEMBLER_FQN] — knows how to
 * reassemble them into the full key byte array. We resolve it via
 * reflection so the runtime AAR has zero compile-time dependency on the
 * generated source set.
 *
 * R8/ProGuard rule:
 *   The consumer-rules.pro on this AAR keeps [ASSEMBLER_FQN] and its
 *   `assemble()` method intact even under aggressive minification. The
 *   generated chunk classes themselves can be (and are) freely renamed,
 *   because [ASSEMBLER_FQN]'s compiled bytecode references them
 *   directly and R8 rewrites those references atomically.
 *
 * Why reflection at all (vs. having the AAR define [ASSEMBLER_FQN])?
 *   [ASSEMBLER_FQN] is per-build; its body changes every build because
 *   the chunk sub-package names are random. The chunk source files only
 *   exist inside the consumer's `build/generated` tree, so the AAR can't
 *   compile-link against them.
