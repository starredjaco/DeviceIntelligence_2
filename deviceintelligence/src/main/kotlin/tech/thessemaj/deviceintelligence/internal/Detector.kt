/**
 * Plug-in contract for one fact-collecting layer of DeviceIntelligence.
 *
 * Every detector is responsible for ONE narrow check (apk integrity,
 * emulator probe, app cloner, etc.) and returns a single
 * [DetectorReport]. The orchestrating [TelemetryCollector] only
 * iterates a registered list of these and concatenates their reports
 * into the final [tech.thessemaj.deviceintelligence.TelemetryReport] — so adding a new
 * detector is purely additive.
 *
 * Implementation rules:
 *  - MUST NOT throw — wrap any unexpected error and return a
 *    [DetectorStatus.ERROR] report. Throwing breaks the entire
 *    collect call for the consumer.
 *  - SHOULD complete in single-digit milliseconds. Anything more
 *    expensive belongs in a separate background task whose state
 *    this detector only summarises.
 *  - MUST be re-entrant safe; the collector may run detectors
 *    concurrently in a future revision.
 *  - MAY hold per-process cached state. The collector itself does
 *    not cache.
