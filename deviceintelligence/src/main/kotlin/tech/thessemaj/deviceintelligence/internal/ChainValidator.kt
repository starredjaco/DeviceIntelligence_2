/**
 * Pure structural / freshness / consistency checks over an attested
 * X.509 chain plus its parsed [KeyDescription][ParsedKeyDescription]
 * extension.
 *
 * Used by [BootloaderIntegrityDetector] (`integrity.bootloader`) to surface specific,
 * stable subreason codes when the chain looks tampered — e.g. cached
 * (Tricky Store style replay), forged structurally, or internally
 * inconsistent with the device state the TEE itself claims.
 *
 * Every function:
 *  - is pure (no Android, no I/O, no global state); takes everything
 *    it needs as arguments
 *  - returns `null` on pass, or a stable lowercase snake_case
 *    subreason string on trip
 *  - is defensive: if the input is missing the data the check needs,
 *    the function returns `null` (defer) rather than tripping on
 *    something it can't actually verify
 *
 * The stable subreason vocabulary is the wire contract that backends
 * key on, so every code added here is documented under
 * `integrity.bootloader` in `docs/DETECTORS.md`.
 *
 * **A note on KeyMint leaf-cert quirks.** Real Android KeyMint
 * implementations populate the attestation leaf cert with intentionally
 * non-meaningful values for certain X.509 fields, because the TEE
 * cannot rely on a wall-clock at keygen time:
 *
 *  - `notBefore = 1970-01-01`, `notAfter = 2048-01-01` (fixed defaults
 *    unless the caller passes [android.security.keystore.KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.setKeyValidityStart]
 *    / `setKeyValidityEnd`, which we deliberately do NOT — we want the
 *    standard chain shape).
 *  - `serialNumber = 1` for every attestation cert (hardcoded in AOSP
 *    `keystore2` / KeyMint).
 *
 * Any check that compares the leaf's `notBefore`/`notAfter`/`serial`
 * to anything time- or uniqueness-meaningful would false-positive on
 * every real device. The validators below sidestep these fields and
 * derive freshness signals from data the TEE *does* sign meaningfully:
 * the embedded attestation challenge and the SubjectPublicKey.
