/**
 * Builders for the new `runtime.environment` finding kinds added by
 * `NATIVE_INTEGRITY_DESIGN.md`. Centralised so:
 *
 *  1. `RuntimeEnvironmentDetector` stays focused on orchestration —
 *     each scan boils down to "call [NativeBridge].xxx, lift the
 *     pipe-delimited records into Findings via this helper, append".
 *  2. The exact `kind` strings, severity choices, and `details`
 *     keys live in one place. Backends pivoting on them should be
 *     able to grep this file to enumerate the full vocabulary.
 *
 * Each builder is a pure function over its inputs (no I/O, no
 * mutable global state) so it's trivial to unit-test the lifting
 * logic without standing up the JNI layer.

     * Common on emulators (the `/vendor/lib64/` GL emulation pipeline
     * is lazy-loaded after `JNI_OnLoad` and therefore misses the
     * baseline) and on OEMs that defer vendor HAL initialisation. We
     * intentionally don't drop the finding — it's still useful

     * than HIGH because the read-only system partitions are
     * dm-verity-protected and tampering with them requires
     * bootloader-unlock + remount, which is independently caught by
     * `runtime.root` / `integrity.bootloader` / `attestation.key`.

     * Crucially this kind is NOT mapped to
     * [IntegritySignal.INJECTED_NATIVE_CODE] in the high-level signal
     * roll-up: a clean emulator must not trip the high-level
     * "injected native code" signal just because the GL stack was
     * lazy-loaded.
