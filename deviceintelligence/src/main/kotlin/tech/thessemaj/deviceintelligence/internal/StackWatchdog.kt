/**
 * G6 — probabilistic call-stack sampler for the
 * [TelemetryCollector.collect] worker thread.
 *
 * StackGuard (G5) gives us a deterministic check at every public
 * API entry point; that catches hooks on the OUTER surface but
 * misses hooks on internal detectors (a Frida script that wraps
 * `MapsParser.parse` or `NativeBridge.scanLoadedLibraries` is
 * invisible to G5 because the user never calls those directly).
 *
 * StackWatchdog fills that gap by spawning a daemon thread for
 * the duration of a `collect()` call. The daemon polls the
 * target thread's stack every [SAMPLE_INTERVAL_MS] and re-uses
 * the same hooker-prefix denylist as [StackGuard]. Each unique
 * `(hookedFrame, foreignFrame.className)` pair is recorded
 * exactly once per scan so a continuously-hooked method doesn't
 * generate one finding per sample.
 *
 * The watchdog is bounded:
 *   - Caps total samples at [MAX_SAMPLES_PER_SCAN] so a long
 *     scan can't run away with thread time.
 *   - Caps recorded violations at [MAX_VIOLATIONS_PER_SCAN]
 *     so a misconfigured device can't return a 100k-element
 *     array.
 *   - Joins the daemon in `finally` with a small grace period;
 *     if the daemon doesn't exit it gets interrupted (the worst
 *     case is that we leak ~one daemon thread per `collect()`,
 *     which is bounded by `collect()` arrival rate — mid-tens
 *     per minute even for the heaviest consumers).
