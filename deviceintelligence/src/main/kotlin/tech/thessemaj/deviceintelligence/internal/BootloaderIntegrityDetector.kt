/**
 * `integrity.bootloader` — bootloader integrity / TEE-attestation
 * tamper detector.
 *
 * `attestation.key` ([KeyAttestationDetector]) faithfully reports
 * what the on-device TEE *claims*. That is the whole point of
 * `attestation.key`, and is what makes its raw `cert_chain_b64`
 * the only authoritative signal — once a backend verifies the
 * chain against Google's pinned root + revocation list.
 *
 * The problem `integrity.bootloader` solves is that on a
 * Magisk-style root with Tricky Store / LSPosed installed, the
 * attacker can hook the AndroidKeyStore surface to return a
 * *previously captured* chain from a clean boot session.
 * `attestation.key` sees a well-formed chain, parses it, and
 * dutifully reports `device_locked = true` even though the
 * userland reports the bootloader as unlocked.
 *
 * `integrity.bootloader` raises the cost of that bypass by
 * running orthogonal cross-checks that a cache-replay forgery
 * struggles to satisfy simultaneously:
 *
 *  1. **Freshness across two attestations** — generates a *second*
 *     attestation under a fresh alias + nonce, and compares it
 *     structurally to `attestation.key`'s. Two consecutive keygens
 *     on the same boot session MUST produce different leaf
 *     SubjectPublicKeys (we asked for two distinct EC keys) and
 *     MUST embed two distinct attestation challenges (we sent two
 *     different nonces). A cache-replay forgery typically returns
 *     the same leaf for every keygen call.
 *  2. **Challenge echo** — the leaf cert MUST embed the exact nonce
 *     we asked the TEE to attest. If it doesn't, the chain was
 *     minted for some other request.
 *  3. **Leaf pubkey matches keystore key** — the leaf cert's
 *     SubjectPublicKey MUST equal the public key the AndroidKeyStore
 *     actually holds for our alias. A naive cached chain serves
 *     someone else's pubkey here.
 *  4. **Chain structural validity** — every cert in the chain must
 *     verify against its issuer; the root must self-sign. Lazy
 *     forgers cut corners on signatures (intermediate windows are
 *     not checked for nesting — see [ChainValidator] for why that
 *     check was unsound and got removed).
 *  5. **StrongBox unexpectedly unavailable** — devices that should
 *     expose a StrongBox-class secure element MUST attest with
 *     security level `STRONG_BOX`. The detector triggers when EITHER
 *     the platform self-reports `FEATURE_STRONGBOX_KEYSTORE`
 *     (the canonical OEM-agnostic capability flag) OR the device
 *     matches the hardcoded Pixel-3+ denylist (paranoid fallback for
 *     when an attacker also hooks the PackageManager feature surface
 *     to hide StrongBox), AND the actual attestation comes back as
 *     `TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT` or `SOFTWARE`. Attackers can't fake
 *     Titan M signatures, so they usually downgrade to TEE attestation
 *     only — making this a load-bearing tamper signal.
 *
 * Output policy (defense-in-depth):
 *  - On a clean device, `integrity.bootloader` emits **zero
 *    findings**. The detector is silent unless something specific
 *    tripped.
 *  - Each tripped check emits its own `bootloader_integrity_anomaly`
 *    Finding with a stable `subreason` code in `details`. Backends
 *    pivot on `subreason`.
 *  - StrongBox unavailability emits a separate
 *    `bootloader_strongbox_unavailable` finding (different
 *    semantics — could legitimately be flaky hardware, hence
 *    MEDIUM severity rather than HIGH).
 *
 * Cost:
 *  - One additional attestation keygen per process (50–500ms TEE,
 *    0.5–4s StrongBox). Cached for the rest of the process lifetime,
 *    same as `attestation.key`.
 *  - Pure cross-check functions (see [ChainValidator]) on top of the
 *    two cached chains — sub-millisecond.
 *
 * Failure-mode policy:
 *  - `attestation.key` didn't cache a result → INCONCLUSIVE
 *    `attestation_key_unavailable`.
 *  - This detector's own keygen failed → INCONCLUSIVE with the same
 *    failure-reason vocabulary `attestation.key` uses
 *    (`attestation_not_supported`, `keystore_error`,
 *    `keystore_unavailable`).
 *  - The detector itself never throws.
 *
 * Authority caveat: like `attestation.key`'s verdict finding, every
 * `integrity.bootloader` finding carries
 * `verdict_authoritative = "false"`. The library does not consider
 * these signals authoritative — they are *advisory*. The
 * authoritative verdict still comes from a backend that re-verifies
 * `attestation.key`'s `cert_chain_b64` against Google's root +
 * revocation list + fleet-wide correlation.
