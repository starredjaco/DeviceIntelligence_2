/**
 * Runtime mirror of the build-time `tech.thessemaj.deviceintelligence.gradle.internal.Fingerprint`
 * data class. The two share an on-disk binary format ([FingerprintCodec]),
 * so any field added here must be added on the plugin side first (and the
 * format version bumped).
 *
 * Currently `internal`; [ApkIntegrityDetector] surfaces only the
 * relevant fields through the public `TelemetryReport` so downstream
 * consumers never depend on this type directly.
 *
 * The `*ByAbi` maps are v2 additions that back the native-integrity /
 * anti-hooking layer (see `NATIVE_INTEGRITY_DESIGN.md`). They're
 * empty when the blob was produced by a v1 plugin; the runtime
 * silently degrades the corresponding native-integrity checks in
 * that case rather than refusing to start.
