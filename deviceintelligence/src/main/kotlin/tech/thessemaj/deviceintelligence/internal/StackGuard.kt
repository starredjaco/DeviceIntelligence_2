/**
 * G5 — deterministic call-stack verification at public API
 * entry points.
 *
 * Every method annotated [Critical] (today: the six top-level
 * entries on [tech.thessemaj.deviceintelligence.DeviceIntelligence])
 * calls [verify] as its first action. We snapshot
 * `Throwable().stackTrace`, walk it bottom-up, and check each
 * frame's class against an allowlist of "this is a frame we
 * expect to legitimately appear above us". Frames outside the
 * allowlist are recorded; the next `runtime.environment`
 * evaluate observes them via [snapshot] and lifts each one
 * into a `stack_foreign_frame` finding.
 *
 * The check is cheap (~2-5 µs per call): no I/O, no allocation
 * beyond the synthetic Throwable + the ArrayList holding any
 * actual violations.
 *
 * The reason we use a synthetic [Throwable] instead of
 * [Thread.currentThread]`.stackTrace` is that the latter is
 * implemented inside ART and is exactly the place a hooker most
 * reliably trampolines. A `new Throwable()` constructor is
 * compiled into our own `.text` and resolved via the GOT we
 * already verify in G4, making it materially harder to bypass
 * StackGuard without also tripping a higher-severity finding.
 *
 * **Storage semantics — deliberately snapshot, not drain.** The
 * pending store is append-only with deduplication and an upper
 * bound; every successful [verify] or [recordWatchdogViolation]
 * adds at most one new entry, and [snapshot] reads the current
 * contents without removing them. This is a security-tool
 * decision rather than a coding convenience: a foreign frame
 * once observed is a permanent fact about the process, and a
 * concurrent reader (e.g. a background pre-warm collect that
 * runs in parallel with an explicit consumer collect) must NOT
 * be able to "consume" the violation away from the explicit
 * collect's report. Drain semantics created exactly that race
 * — see commit history for the verification logs that revealed
 * it.
 *
 * Deduplication key is `(hookedMethod, className, methodName,
 * lineNumber, source)`, which collapses the typical pattern
 * "the same Frida-script frame appears on the stack of every
 * collect() invocation" down to one finding. The cap
 * ([MAX_PENDING]) protects long-running processes from
 * unbounded growth if an attacker churns hook frames; once
 * full, the oldest entry is evicted (FIFO).
