/**
 * `runtime.environment` — In-process runtime-environment detector.
 *
 * Surfaces tampering signals that show up *inside our own process*
 * the moment something attaches to or injects into us:
 *  - A debugger / tracer is attached. Catches both the JDWP debugger
 *    (covered by [Debug.isDebuggerConnected]) and any native tracer
 *    attached via `ptrace` (gdb, lldb, frida-trace, strace),
 *    surfaced via the `TracerPid:` line in `/proc/self/status`.
 *  - The app's own `FLAG_DEBUGGABLE` disagrees with the system's
 *    `ro.debuggable`. Either side being lifted from 0 to 1 is the
 *    classic repackaging tell — release APKs from a real Play Store
 *    install always have the flag at 0 and a stock OS always has
 *    `ro.debuggable=0` outside of `userdebug` builds.
 *  - A known userland hooking framework's library is mapped into
 *    our address space (Frida, Substrate, Xposed, LSPosed, Riru,
 *    Zygisk, Taichi). The match list is intentionally narrow: every
 *    entry is a framework whose presence in any production process
 *    is, by itself, a meaningful tampering signal.
 *  - A read-write-executable memory mapping exists in the process.
 *    The Android loader never produces RWX pages — code is RX, data
 *    is RW, ro-data is R. RWX is exclusively the JIT region of an
 *    in-process trampoline / hot-patching engine.
 *
 * All four checks share a single `/proc/self/maps` read (~200-500
 * KB string materialized once via [NativeBridge.procSelfMaps]) and
 * a single `/proc/self/status` read. Result is cached for the
 * process lifetime; all four signals are properties that cannot
 * change while the process runs.
 *
 * Stays declared as `object` to match the rest of the detector
 * fleet's pattern.
