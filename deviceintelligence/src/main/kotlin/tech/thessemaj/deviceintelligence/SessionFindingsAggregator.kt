/**
 * Stateful aggregator that turns a stream of [TelemetryReport]s
 * into a stream of cumulative [SessionFindings] snapshots.
 *
 * Public because consumers may want to drive the aggregation
 * themselves — for example, a UI that funnels both periodic
 * `observe()` ticks and explicit "Re-collect" button presses
 * through one shared session. The Flow-based wrapper
 * [DeviceIntelligence.observeSession] uses this internally; it
 * is the right choice when you only have one source of reports.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin / pure logic — no Android, no coroutine machinery.
 *
 * Identity: two findings are the same iff
 * `(detectorId, kind, subject)` matches. See [TrackedFinding] for
 * the rationale.
 *
 * Insertion order: [LinkedHashMap] preserves first-seen order, so
 * the [SessionFindings.findings] list is naturally chronological.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: each instance is intended to be driven by a
 * single coroutine. The `flow {}` wrapper provides that contract
 * automatically (`collect` is sequential within one collector).
