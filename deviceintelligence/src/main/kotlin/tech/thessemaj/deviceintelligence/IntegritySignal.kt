/**
 * Coarse, backend-friendly classification of what a [TelemetryReport]
 * actually *means*.
 *
 * [TelemetryReport] is intentionally low-level: every detector reports
 * its individual [Finding]s with stable per-kind identifiers
 * (`apk_signer_mismatch`, `art_method_entry_drifted`,
 * `injected_anonymous_executable`, …). That granularity is the right
 * thing to ship to a backend — it preserves forensic evidence and
 * lets a SOC team pivot on individual signals — but it is the wrong
 * thing to put in front of a product code path that only needs to
 * know "should I trust this session?".
 *
 * [IntegritySignal] folds the ~40 per-kind identifiers into 11
 * orthogonal high-level buckets. Consumers who only need a verdict
 * (UI gating, telemetry counters, support-tooling banners) can pivot
 * on this set directly; consumers who need the underlying evidence
 * still have the original [Finding]s available via
 * [IntegritySignalReport.evidence].
 *
 * The mapping is **deliberately conservative**: a single finding
 * always maps to exactly one signal; any unrecognised finding kind
 * (e.g. a kind added in a newer library version that this consumer
 * hasn't been recompiled against) is surfaced via
 * [IntegritySignalReport.unmappedFindings] rather than silently
 * dropped.
 *

     *     Verified` — the TEE asserts that the device booted from
     *     a locked bootloader running an OS image that matches the
     *     factory-signed verified-boot root of trust.
     *  2. Any active userspace tamper finding from
     *     [HOOKING_FRAMEWORK_DETECTED] is also present in the same
     *     report (Frida agent / Xposed / LSPosed / runtime DEX
     *     injection / RWX trampoline / GOT drift / `.text` drift /
     *     ART-internals tampering).
     *
     * Either signal alone is interesting. The combination is
     * extraordinary: the hardware says "this is a clean,
     * locked-bootloader device running a real signed OS," and the
     * userspace simultaneously says "this process is being actively
     * hooked." Two explanations are possible:
     *
     *  - **TEE compromise** — rare but known on certain
     *    Exynos/Qualcomm/MediaTek silicon with published vulnerabilities,
     *    Pixel firmwares with developer-side TEE bypasses, or devices
     *    with custom firmware that maintains a verified-boot signature
     *    while subverting userspace.
     *  - **Sophisticated post-attestation injection** — an attacker
     *    who passed verified boot (legitimate-looking OS) and then
     *    injected userspace tooling against the running process.
     *    Common with Magisk on devices that pass attestation via
     *    Shamiko / Magisk hide.
     *
     * Either way, this is the highest-confidence "this session is
     * compromised" signal a backend can receive. Backends should
     * weight it equivalently to a hard block / step-up
     * authentication / kill-switch decision; weighting it the same
     * as a generic [HOOKING_FRAMEWORK_DETECTED] would understate
     * how anomalous the combination is.
     *
     * Backed by `attestation.key` finding kind:
     * `hardware_attested_but_userspace_tampered`. The derived finding
