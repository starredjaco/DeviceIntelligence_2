/**
 * The single, structured output of a DeviceIntelligence run.
 *
 * DeviceIntelligence is a *telemetry* layer — it collects facts about the runtime
 * environment of the host app and hands them back as a serialisable
 * report. It does NOT decide whether the app should keep running,
 * shut down, lock the user out, or anything else. That decision
 * belongs to the consumer's backend or in-app policy layer, working
 * off of (typically) [toJson] uploaded from the device.
 *
 * The schema is intentionally flat and stable. Every value below is
 * either a primitive, a string, or a list/map of those — no enums or
 * sealed-class hierarchies leak into the wire format. This means:
 *  - Backends can parse the JSON with any vanilla JSON library.
 *  - Adding a new detector / finding kind is purely additive: it
 *    appears as an extra entry in [detectors] / a new value of
 *    [Finding.kind], without breaking older consumers.
 *  - [schemaVersion] is bumped only on breaking changes.
 *
 * Consumers MUST treat [Finding.kind] and [Finding.severity] as the
 * stable contract; [Finding.details] is opaque diagnostic data whose
 * keys may change without a schema bump.

 *  - Skip an expensive detector on a hot path (e.g. drop
